These files have been generated with the following commands:

1. List all the Exports
   dumpbin /exports winhv.sys > winhv_exports.txt
   dumpbin /exports winhvr.sys > winhvr_exports.txt

2. Copy all the names and the ordinals in a DEF file like the following:
   LIBRARY WinHv
   EXPORTS
   DllInitialize
   DllUnload                           
   DriverEntry                        
   WinHvAcceptGpaPages 
   <List of Exported Entry Points>

3. Generate the LIB files
   lib /def:winhv_exports.txt /out:winhv.lib

Simple, isn't it?
