These files have been generated with the following commands:

1. List all the Exports
   dumpbin /exports winhv.sys > winhv_exports.txt
   dumpbin /exports winhvr.sys > winhvr_exports.txt

2. Copy all the names (and optionally the ordinals) in a DEF file like the following:
   LIBRARY WinHv
   EXPORTS
   DllInitialize @1
   DllUnload @2                          
   DriverEntry @3                       
   WinHvAcceptGpaPages @4
   <List of Exported Entry Points>

3. Generate the LIB files
   lib /def:winhv_exports.def /out:winhv.lib

Simple, isn't it?
